# ETCH-A-SKETCH

Etch a sketch project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## Description
Draw using the selected color and change the grid size according to your needs.
Grid size can go from **16x16** to **64x64**.

Users can also change the opacity of the current color.

Button modes:
* Draw - Changes color based on the currently selected color
* Rainbow - Each color is randomly selected regardless of the currently selected color
* Erase - 'Erases' the current color, more specifically changes it to default(white)
* Pick - Picks any color, but only from the grid, and changes the color picker value to that color

Each button works only when the power is on.
